## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.0+
- Composer
- Apache/Nginx with mod_rewrite
- Google Cloud Account

---

### Step 1 — Install Dependencies

```bash
cd tbi_task_manager
composer install
```

---

### Step 2 — Google Sheets Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a project → Enable **Google Sheets API**
3. Go to **Credentials** → **Create Service Account**
4. Download the JSON key → rename to `credentials.json` → place in `config/`
5. Create a new **Google Sheet** in your Google Drive
6. Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE/edit`
7. **Share** the spreadsheet with the service account email (from credentials.json `client_email`) — give **Editor** access

---

### Step 3 — Configure

Edit `config/config.php`:

```php
define('SPREADSHEET_ID', 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE');
define('BASE_URL',       '/tbi_task_manager');   // adjust to your web path
```

For email (forgot password):
```php
define('SMTP_USER', 'your-gmail@gmail.com');
define('SMTP_PASS', 'your-16-char-app-password');
```
> Use a Gmail **App Password** (not your regular password). Enable 2FA first.

---

### Step 4 — Initialize Sheets

Visit in browser (run once):
```
http://localhost/tbi_task_manager/setup/setup_sheets.php?key=TBI_SETUP_2024
```

Or via CLI:
```bash
php setup/setup_sheets.php
```

This creates all sheets, headers, 6 sample employees, sample tasks, and login accounts.

> **IMPORTANT:** After running, restrict access to the setup file or delete it.

---

### Step 5 — Web Server

**Apache** — ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled and `AllowOverride All` is set.

**Nginx** — add to your server block:
```nginx
location /tbi_task_manager {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /tbi_task_manager/index.php?$query_string;
}
```

## Security Notes

- Passwords are stored as **bcrypt hashes** in Google Sheets
- CSRF tokens protect all forms
- Sessions expire after 2 hours of inactivity
- HTTP security headers are set via `.htaccess`
- `credentials.json` and `vendor/` are blocked by `.htaccess`
- Never commit `credentials.json` to version control

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Blank page | Check PHP error log; enable `display_errors` temporarily |
| Sheets not updating | Verify service account has Editor access to the sheet |
| Login fails | Run setup script again; check `Users` sheet has data |
| Email not sending | Use Gmail App Password, not account password |
| Charts blank | Check browser console for JS errors |
